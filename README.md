# Set Game on iphone
An implementation of the game of set in Swift/iOS.  
The rules of Set Game can be seen here: (see rules: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game))  

TL;DR: It's a card matching game with 81 unique cards based on shapes, the shading of the shape, the number of times a shape appears on a card , and the color of the shape. There are 3 variations of each of these atributes (3^4 = 81 cards). The goal of the game is to make sets of 3 cards until all 81 cards are gone. A set of 3 is made by either all attributes except one being the same, or the cards only sharing one attribute. It is an easy game to understand but can be challenging to play.  

# What I Learned
-> How to use NSAttributedString and how to draw shapes using UIBezierPath  
-> Resizing of cards using a grid style based on the number of cards in play
